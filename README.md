# 7C Poems

This is a website made to display poems as a sharing website and resource for students in Singapore American School. It’s made using React, TypeScript, and Next.js, bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Testing locally

To test it on your own computer, make sure you have [npm](https://npmjs.com), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed. Then clone this repo by `cd`ing to any directory and running
```bash
gh repo clone FryingggPannn/7c-poems
```
Then install all required dependencies using
```bash
yarn
```
and start a development server with
```bash
yarn dev
```
Then the website will be available at <https://localhost:3000>.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
